** a few weapons (swiss, spr, fennec, and a couple others) are configured with bullet velocity/prediction values that are not derived from meta builds (Agency/GRU suppressor, Task Force barrel)

** mouse back button is a sniper key which behaves like a very low FOV silent aim - the FOV is somewhat wider at closer ranges, so as long as you are reasonably accurate, you can quickscope people that are near.

** weapons velocity values have not been updated since September 2021 - some may be out of date and bullet prediction may be negatively affected

** 2DRadar will have to be adjusted in both settings files.
